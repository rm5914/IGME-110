        <div class = "a"> Since the creation of Harry Potter, it has played a significant role on people around the world. It has changed the genre of Fantasy. Children didn't want to touch that genre back in the 1990s, but it resurged once the series was created. It helped improve the publishing industry as a whole. There was an increase amount of young adult writers and people writing fanfiction about things they read. There was also the invention of the fictional turned reality sport Quidditch. </div>
