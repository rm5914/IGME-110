        <h2>Renee Mei</h2>
        
        <p> <dd> My name is Renee Mei and I go to college at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am 18 years old and my birthday is on August 16, 2001. I have an older sister and a younger brother so that makes me the middle child. I am very close to my family, especially with my cousins who live in the floor below us. I live in New York City, specifically Brooklyn, New York.</dd> </p>
        
        <p> <dd> I have a couple of hobbies like playing videogames and reading fanfiction. I usually play Elder Scrolls: Skyrim on my laptop and when I read fanfiction, it's usually about something I watched recently or a topic I want to revisit. I love to watch sports anime like Prince of Tennis and Kuroko no Basket. I enjoy spending time with my friends and making plans with them like going to eat lunch or watching movies in the theater. </dd> </p>
